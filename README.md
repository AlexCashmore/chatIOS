# chatIOS

my first app made in XCode , for IOS 11+ using Swift 5, Cocoa Pods and UIKit (not SwiftUI), Authentication and bucket storage with Firebase.
The idea is to recreate a simple chat app which will have many cross over usecases with modern mobile applications.
Learning to do this myself to gather an understanding of Swift and Objective C
